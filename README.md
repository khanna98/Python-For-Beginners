## Introduction
Python was developed by **Guido Van Rossum** in the late eighties and early nineties at the **National Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science, Netherlands**.
Python is an interpretted language i.e, Python has a design which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.

#### Features of Python Language
1. **Easy to learn :** Python has a fewer keywords, simple structure and a clearly defined synatx. This allows students to pick up the language quickly.
2. **Easy to read :** Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
3. **Easy to maintain :** Python's source code is fairly easy to maintain.
4. **A broad standard library :** Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows and Macintosh.
5. **Interactive Module :** Python has a support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
6. **Portable :** Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platform and has the same interface on all platforms.
7. **Extendable :** You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.
8. **Databases :** Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
9. **GUI Programming :** Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
10. **Scaleable :** Python provides a better structure and support for large programs that shell scipting.

Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few are listed below :
1. It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
2. It can be used as a scripting language or can be complied to byte-code for building large applications.
3. It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
4. Python supports automatic garbage collection.
5. It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiceX, CORBA, and Java.


## Operators in Python

Operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.
Consider the experssion 4 + 5 = 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called the operands and + is called operator

**Types of Operator:**

Python supports the following type of operators :
   
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison (Relational) Operators
3. Assignment Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Bitwise Operators
6. Membership Operators
7. Identity Operators

#### Aritmetic Operators

|**Operator**|**Description**|**Example**|
|------------|---------------|-----------|
|`+` Addition| Adds value on either side of the operator.|a + b = 30|
|`-` Subtraction| Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.|a - b = -10|
|`*` Multiplication| Mutiplies values on either side of the operator.|a * b = 200|
|`/` Division| Divides the left hand operand by the right hand operand.|b / a = 2|
|`%` Modulus| Divides the left hand operand by the right hand operand and returns the remainder.|b % a = 0|
|`**` Exponential| Performs the exponential (power) calculation on operators.|a ** b = 10 to the power 20
|`//` Floor Division| The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after decimal pointa are removed. But if one of the operand is negative, the result is floored i.e rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity).|9 // 2 = 4 and 9 / 2 = 4.5, -11 // 3 = -4,-11|
